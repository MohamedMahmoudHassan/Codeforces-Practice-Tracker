# Codeforces-Practice-Tracer
A chrome extension that helps codeforces users to track their practice progress through time phases (currently time phase is 7 days).
It can be useful also for competitive programming trainers who want to keep updates about their trainees.

### For each phase, you can show:   
  - Number of solved problems.   
  - Number of submissions.   
  - Hardest (Max Rated) problem you solved.  
  - Average of the rates of the problems you solved.  
  - Number of contests and virtuals you participated.  
  - Statics of submissions.

### More features: 
  - Show each phase and compare it with previous one.
  - Skip inactive phases.
